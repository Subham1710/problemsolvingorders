Q)How would you handle the scenario where it takes 2 minutes to fetch data from the backend to the frontend, specifically for a large number of orders, and ensure that the data is not empty for the entire 2-minute duration? Could you please provide an example code snippet in JavaScript to demonstrate your approach?
